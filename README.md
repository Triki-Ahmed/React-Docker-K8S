# React-Docker-K8S
A small proof of concept with React, Docker, and Minikube that  involve creating a simple React application, dockerizing it, and deploying it on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

# POC Summary: Git, React, Docker, and Minikube

1. Set up a basic React application using create-react-app or a similar tool.

2. Create a Dockerfile to containerize the React application, defining the environment and dependencies needed to run the app within a Docker container.

3. Build a Docker image for the React app using the Dockerfile and run the container locally to ensure it works as expected.

4. Install Minikube, a tool for running a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally, and start the Minikube cluster.

5. Create Kubernetes deployment and service configuration files to deploy the Dockerized React app within the Minikube cluster.

6. Deploy the Dockerized React app to the Minikube cluster using the kubectl command-line tool.
